This project focuses on detecting Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 

The goal is to classify X-rays into Pneumonia or Normal with high accuracy, supporting early diagnosis using deep learning.

Key Features
Image classification using CNN and transfer learning 

Achieved ~87.5% validation accuracy

Implemented learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau)

Used data augmentation for better generalization
